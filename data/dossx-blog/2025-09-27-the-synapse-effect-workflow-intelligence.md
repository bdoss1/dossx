### The Hidden Tax on Growth

Most companies don’t lose time in the big moments — they lose it in the seams. That CSV someone exports on Fridays. The Slack ping asking, “Do we have the latest numbers?” The campaign that launches *almost* on time because the data was “nearly” right.

**[Synapse](/agents/synapse)** eliminates that friction. It’s our workflow intelligence layer that connects apps, cleans data, and coordinates actions across your stack.

### What Synapse Does (and Why It’s Different)

**1) Connects the stack** — CRMs, ERPs, data warehouses, email, ad platforms.  
**2) Normalizes data** — dedupes, standardizes, and validates in the background.  
**3) Detects patterns** — outliers, anomalies, and triggers that deserve action.  
**4) Orchestrates actions** — launch a sequence, open a ticket, ping finance, resync the record.

This isn’t an “IFTTT for enterprise.” It’s a **reasoning‑aware** engine that understands intent and downstream impact.

### A Story: The Campaign That Launched Itself

A retailer’s “VIP drop” launches quarterly. Previously, ops scrambled: lists from CRM, product availability from ERP, segments from email, approvals from legal. With Synapse live:  
- Segments auto‑updated based on fresh CRM data.  
- Inventory thresholds triggered pre‑launch lobbying to restock.  
- Approvals were packaged with context and due dates.  
- The campaign launched on time — **every time** — with fewer late‑night fire drills.

---

### What’s Under the Hood

- **Reasoning + RAG** over business rules and runbooks.  
- **Connectors** for major SaaS + a webhook kit for anything bespoke.  
- **Observability** dashboards and replayable runs.  
- **Governance** with audit trails and role‑based controls.

### Where Synapse Shines

- **RevOps:** lifecycle hygiene, MQL → SQL handoffs, pipeline accuracy.  
- **Marketing Ops:** data alignment, segment accuracy, campaign readiness.  
- **Support Ops:** triage rules, SLA monitors, proactive detection.  
- **Back Office:** invoice sync, inventory flips, exception handling.

### Final Word

Growth comes from momentum. Synapse is how you keep it — by automating the unseen work that would’ve slowed you down.
