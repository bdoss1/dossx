### The Follow‑Up That Never Happened

Picture this: a prospect fills out your form at 11:42 p.m. By morning, another vendor booked the meeting. Not because they were better — but because they **replied first**.

**[QuotaX](/agents/sales)** fixes that. It’s your AI sales engine that captures, enriches, nurtures, and books meetings — automatically. Your reps focus on closing; QuotaX handles the rest.

### What QuotaX Actually Does

**1) Captures and qualifies** from forms, chat, inbound emails, even phone calls (via Voxia).  
**2) Enriches leads** with firmographic data (industry, size, tech stack) and routes intelligently.  
**3) Personalizes outreach** using persona‑aware templates and behavioral signals.  
**4) Books meetings** by syncing calendars and proposing available times instantly.  
**5) Keeps the CRM clean** with structured fields, notes, and outcomes — no “mystery deals.”

### Real Results, Real Fast

A B2B SaaS team plugged QuotaX into their site and outbound sequences. Within two months:  
- **MQL → SQL up 52%** from faster, more relevant replies.  
- **No‑show rate down 23%** thanks to smart reminders with value hooks.  
- **Rep time reclaimed:** ~8–10 hours/week moved from admin to selling.

---

### How It Works (Under the Hood)

- **Reasoning:** OpenAI orchestrates multi‑step flows (qualify → propose → follow‑up).  
- **Tone:** Brand‑trained copy that adapts to buyer persona and stage.  
- **Integrations:** HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Gmail/Outlook, Slack, Stripe.  
- **Scheduling:** Calendar sync with guardrails for buffers/time‑zones.  
- **Governance:** Role‑based access, approvals for regulated outreach, and audit logs.

### Playbook: Where to Start

1. **Top‑of‑funnel capture:** auto‑respond within 60 seconds — day or night.  
2. **Mid‑funnel sequencing:** 3–5 step follow‑ups tuned by persona.  
3. **Handoff to humans:** high‑intent leads → rep, everything else → nurture.  
4. **Closed‑loop reporting:** win/loss summaries to sharpen messaging.

### What About Brand Voice and Control?

QuotaX isn’t a rogue robot. You approve the voice, rules, and thresholds. Want legal review on outbound? Fine. Want reps to one‑click insert a QuotaX‑drafted reply? Also fine. You’re always in control.

### Final Word

Speed still wins deals. QuotaX gives you “always‑on salesmanship” — the kind that responds first, follows up forever, and respects your brand.
