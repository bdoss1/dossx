### The Moment a Missed Call Became a Missed Opportunity

Every founder has felt it: the pang when a hot lead slips into voicemail, or a frustrated customer hangs up after too many menu prompts. One multi-location service company told us, “We’re great **when we pick up**… we just don’t always pick up.” That’s the gap **[Voxia](/agents/voice)** closes — a 24/7 AI voice concierge that sounds human, understands context, and acts on real data from your systems.

Voxia isn’t a script. It’s a live conversational layer powered by ElevenLabs + OpenAI that **answers questions, books appointments, checks order status, and escalates to humans** when appropriate. Think “your best first responder” that never sleeps.

### What Makes Voxia Different (and Why It Matters)

**1) Natural conversation, not robotic menus.**  
Callers speak normally. Voxia recognizes intent, asks clarifying questions, and responds in warm, brand-aligned voice — no “press 5 for support.”

**2) Real integrations = real outcomes.**  
Because Voxia connects to your **calendar, CRM, and database**, it can *do* things: schedule, reschedule, look up order status, verify account details, and send summaries to staff in Slack/Teams.

**3) Instant escalation when it counts.**  
If a call is complex, sensitive, or high-value, Voxia triggers a **live handoff** and posts a compact context summary to your team’s channel. Humans step in with all the context, not chaos.

**4) Analytics you can actually use.**  
Every call becomes structured data: intent, resolution, sentiment. You’ll see **CSAT trends, call deflection %, booking conversion**, and time-of-day traffic patterns you can staff around.

### A Quick Story: From Voicemail Graveyard to Booked-Out Calendar

A specialty clinic had a familiar problem: most inquiries landed after hours, and weekend voicemails weren’t checked until Monday afternoon. Within 48 hours of going live, **Voxia cut missed calls to nearly zero**. Appointments booked during nights and weekends rose **3.8×**, while average handle time dropped by **41%** thanks to automatic intake questions. Human staff now tackle **edge cases, not everything**.

### Under the Hood (for the technical folks)

- **Runtime:** ElevenLabs Voice + OpenAI reasoning for natural interactions.  
- **Knowledge:** RAG over your knowledge base + dynamic DB queries.  
- **Integrations:** Google Calendar/Outlook, Stripe, CRMs (HubSpot/Salesforce), ticketing, and custom webhooks.  
- **Safety:** Guardrails, fallback flows, profanity filters, and audit logs.  
- **Deployment:** Web widget, phone routing (Twilio/Zoom/Teams), Slack/Teams intake lines.

### Where Voxia Wins First

- **Bookings & scheduling** for clinics, real estate, legal, home services.  
- **Order lookups & FAQs** for e‑commerce and retail.
