### Service overview

Data lives everywhere—Stripe, Shopify, Google Ads, your own Postgres—but leadership still waits on weekly spreadsheets to see what’s happening. **SwiftInsights** stitches those sources together with no-code ETL workflows, drops them into a managed warehouse, and layers on AI-driven dashboards that predict trends before they appear in the bank account.

### Our service includes

**Source Connectors:** One-click sync for databases, SaaS apps, ad platforms, and even CSV uploads.  

**AI Forecasting & Anomaly Detection:** GPT-powered models highlight revenue dips or cost overruns 30 days out.  

**Custom KPI Dashboards:** Tailored views for execs, marketing, finance—all styled to your brand.  

**Automated Alerts:** Slack, email, or SMS pings when metrics cross predefined thresholds.  

**Governance & Security:** Role-based access controls and audit trails, with SOC 2-ready logging.

### Why Choose Us

Most BI tools show you *what* happened. SwiftInsights shows you **why**—and alerts you *before* it matters. Clients report up to 25 % faster decision cycles and newfound confidence in every growth move.
