### Service overview

Turn static support pages and clunky forms into intelligent, conversational experiences. DossX designs and deploys custom GPT-4 / Gemini chatbots and orchestrates behind-the-scenes AI agents that handle everything from ticket triage to personalized product recommendations. Whether you need a single FAQ bot or a fleet of collaborative agents running on n8n, we bake conversational AI directly into your existing stack—with enterprise-grade security and analytics.

### Our service includes

**Conversational Design:** Persona crafting, intent mapping, and prompt engineering for natural, brand-aligned chat.  

**RAG & Knowledge Bases:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines that serve accurate, up-to-date answers from your docs or database.  

**Multi-Agent Orchestration:** n8n workflows where specialized agents (support, sales, billing) collaborate to complete complex tasks.  

**Omni-Channel Deployment:** Web widget, Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, or your mobile app—one engine, many touchpoints.  

**Analytics & Optimization:** Live dashboards tracking CSAT, resolution time, and deflection rates, plus A/B prompt testing.

### Why Choose Us

Most “chatbot” vendors stop at canned replies. We build full-stack agent ecosystems that **solve** problems, shave hours off staff workload, and delight users—often delivering ROI within the first month of going live.
