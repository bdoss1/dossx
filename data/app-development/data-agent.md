### Service overview

DataAgent keeps your records clean and in sync across CRMs, ERPs, support tools, and databases. It detects anomalies, prevents duplicates, and maintains a reliable source of truth—so analytics and automations actually work.

**Data Cleansing & Standardization:** Normalize names, addresses, and custom fields with AI-assisted rules.  
**De-duplication at Scale:** Merge logic that preserves history and ownership while removing clutter.  
**Multi-Source Connectors:** CRMs, ERPs, warehouses, and operational DBs—mapped and synced.  
**Anomaly Detection:** Flag outliers, broken fields, and suspicious spikes with smart alerts.  
**Lineage & Governance:** Track transformations and access with audit-friendly visibility.
