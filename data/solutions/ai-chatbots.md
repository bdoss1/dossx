### Service overview

At DossX, we build LLM-powered chatbots and AI assistants that live in your web app, Slack, Teams, SMS and more. By combining GPT-4 (or your fine-tuned model) with persistent context storage, we deliver always-on, hyper-personalized conversations that drive lead qualification, customer support, and internal productivity.

### Our service includes

- **Agent Design & Training:** Persona definition, prompt engineering, and memory schema setup for natural, brand-aligned dialogue.  
- **Multi-Channel Deployment:** One build deploys to web widgets, Slack/Teams bots, Telegram, or SMSâ€”no duplicated work.  
- **Monitoring & Analytics:** Conversation logs, performance dashboards, and usage alerts to optimize your AI ROI.

### Why Choose Us

- **Enterprise-Grade Reliability:** SLA-backed hosting, auto-scaling, and failover ensure your chatbot never sleeps.  
- **Deep Personalization:** Context protocols let your agent remember user preferences and past sessions for more human interactions.  
- **Rapid Iteration:** Agile development sprints mean new skills, integrations, or UX tweaks roll out in days, not months.
