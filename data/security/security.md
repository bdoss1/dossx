| Layer          | Controls Implemented                                                  |
|--------------- |---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Infrastructure** | Hosted on AWS & GCP with ISO 27001 and SOC 2 certified data centers. |
| **Network**        | VPC segmentation, firewalls, and DDoS protection via AWS Shield. |
| **Application**    | OWASP-guided coding standards, static code analysis, and automated dependency scanning. |
| **Identity & Access** | SSO via Clerk, role-based access, MFA enforced for all internal accounts. |
| **Encryption**     | TLS 1.2+ in transit; AES-256 at rest for databases, backups, and object storage. |
