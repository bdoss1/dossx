# Data & AI Ethics

**Effective Date:** April 2, 2025  

At **DossX**, ethical use of data and artificial intelligence is foundational to how we design, develop, and deliver our products. This policy outlines the principles and practices that govern every AI-powered feature and automation workflow we provide.

## 1. Guiding Principles

| Principle              | What It Means at DossX                                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Transparency**       | We communicate how our AI systems work, what data they use, and the limits of their outputs. |
| **Fairness & Bias Mitigation** | We monitor and test for unwanted bias in training data and model outputs—continually refining prompts and datasets. |
| **Accountability**     | Humans remain in the loop; DossX engineers oversee AI decisions, and users can escalate concerns. |
| **Privacy by Design**  | All AI features are built to honor the data-minimization and purpose-limitation principles in our Privacy Policy. |
| **Security**           | AI pipelines inherit the same encryption, access control, and monitoring standards detailed in our Security & Compliance policy. |

## 2. Responsible Data Use

- **Data Collection:** We collect only what is needed to deliver or improve an AI feature.  
- **Data Storage:** Personal data is encrypted at rest and in transit; prompts and logs are retained only as long as required for the stated purpose.  
- **Data Sharing:** We do not sell user data. Third-party AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google) are limited to processing instructions necessary to complete the request.

## 3. Model Selection & Training

1. **Third-Party Models**  
   We primarily leverage industry-leading providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini) that publish safety mechanisms and offer enterprise compliance options.

2. **Custom Fine-Tuning**  
   - Strict dataset vetting for legal or ethical red flags.  
   - Continuous evaluation for bias, toxicity, or misinformation.  
   - Rollback plan if a model exhibits harmful behavior.

## 4. Human Oversight

- **Preview & Approval:** Critical AI actions (e.g., bulk email sends, customer-facing chat responses) include a manual “approve” step unless you explicitly enable full automation.  
- **Feedback Loop:** Every AI interaction can be rated by users; negative feedback routes to our ethics review board within 24 hours.

## 5. User Responsibilities

- Avoid inputting content that violates laws or third-party rights.  
- Refrain from using AI outputs to spread misinformation, harass individuals, or perform illegal activities.  
- Report any harmful or biased output via **ethics@dossx.com**.

---

## 6. Governance & Review

- Quarterly audits by an internal Data Ethics Committee.  
- Annual external review aligned with OECD AI Principles and ISO/IEC 24028 guidelines.  
- Public changelog for significant policy updates.

## 7. Updates to This Policy

We may revise this policy to reflect new regulations or best practices. Changes take effect upon posting with a revised effective date.
