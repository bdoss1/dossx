### Get to Know the Project â€“ Overview & Highlights

Data pipelines extract, transform, and load (ETL) data across systems. DossX uses n8n and Supabase to create low-code pipelines that empower teams to analyze data without a data engineering team.

Key highlights include:

- **Source connectors** for SQL databases, APIs, and file storage.  
- **Transformation nodes** to normalize, enrich, and dedupe records.  
- **Destination hooks** into analytics platforms like Tableau or Looker.  
- **Scheduling & triggers** for near-real-time data updates.

### Building Strategies for the Future

To build scalable pipelines:

1. **Design reusable templates:** Standardize common transformations.  
2. **Implement monitoring alerts:** Notify on pipeline failures or data anomalies.  
3. **Optimize performance:** Batch processing and parallel execution.

### Overcoming Obstacles

ETL pipeline challenges:

- **Schema changes:** Build versioned transformations to handle evolving data structures.  
- **Error propagation:** Implement robust retry and dead-letter queues.  
- **Cost management:** Track execution time and optimize resource usage.  

By addressing these, organizations can ensure reliable, scalable data flows.
